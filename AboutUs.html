            <h1>About Gamesaru</h1>
            <p>"Game Saru was established in 2017 with one goal: to bring the high-quality arcades of Japan to America for people to play, experience, and own. <br> <br>
                Our passion for the history of these games and the love we have for them is what inspired us in the beginning, and it continues to drive us today. 
                We pride ourselves in the superior experience of our arcade, the machines we sell, and the long-term relationships we've built with our customers. 
                People come back to Game Saru because they know they will find what they are looking for. Stop by or drop us a line to see for yourself!</p>
                
            <p>David filed for a business license for Game Saru on January 4th, 2018 to bring free play arcades to Fanime. <br> <br>
                For years, many in the North California community sought to make this happen, but were never taken seriously. 
                The formation of a business entity was necessary to open the door, and it fell on him to do it. 
                What started as a desire to fulfill this one objective turned into a five-year commitment to build the finest Japanese arcade rental and sales company the West Coast has ever seen. 
                 It took a massive sacrifice to grow the empire in such a short time, but it was worth it."
